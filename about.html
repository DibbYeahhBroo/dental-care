        <h1>Advanced Dental Techniques</h1><hr>
        <div id="para"><p>The dedication to our patients does not stop at your comfort level either; we also strive to stay ahead of the curve when it comes to dental advancements. We believe it is worth the investment to maintain state-of-the-art dental technologies and equipment, which translates to faster appointments and more affordable care! It also means you are receiving the most accurate and gentle care available to the market. We treat our patients like family, and we don’t give our family anything but the best!<br><br>Intraoral cameras are slim, handheld devices that are used to stream a high-definition video feed of the inside of a patient’s mouth to a computer screen so that both the doctor and patient can get a close-up view of the patient’s teeth and gums. They can also be used to take digital impressions of teeth, which are necessary for creating dental crowns, orthodontic treatment plans, and a variety of other services. Intraoral cameras are efficient, highly-effective, and negate the need for messy dental impressions using goopy dental putty.</p>
